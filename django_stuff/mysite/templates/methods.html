<tr> <td colspan="3"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To assess the effect of Redlining, we compare outcomes on either side of HOLC boundaries demarcating areas that received different grades. We first identified the HOLC boundaries using data from the <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/36.71/-96.93&opacity=0.8">Mapping Inequality</a> project at the University of Richmond. We then generate a 1/4 mile “buffer” on either side of the border between HOLC areas of different grades and restrict our analysis to the areas that fall within these “boundary buffers” as shown in figure 1 below. Note that borders demarcating areas that received the same HOLC grade are not considered in our analysis as we are interested in the differences in outcomes between areas that received different HOLC grades.

<tr> <td colspan="3"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We chose to restrict our focus to the areas on either side of the boundary to (very roughly) approximate the a border regression discontinuity design (RD) that has been used in previous work on Redlining (e.g., Holmes 1998; Black 1999; Bayer et al 2007; and Dube et al 2010 - update) as well as extensively throughout the academic literature studying differences across borders (add examples). The logic behind a RD design is that the pretreatment (where the treatment is the establishment of the HOLC boundaries) conditions within a small distance of a border are most likely to be similar. This allows us to control for other factors that we would expect to affect our outcomes of interest besides redlining (such as access to transportation networks, proximity to commercial centers, etc.) as we could expect that these factors would be constant within a quarter mile of the boundary. In addition, other major changes that would occur over the 70 year time period of our analysis (such as the construction of a highway, or extreme weather)  would presumably affect the areas within the half-mile equally. Therefore, by comparing differences across the buffer borders, we are ideally comparing areas that are alike in all relevant ways except for the different HOLC grades assigned.</td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan="3"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp However, this approach relies on the assumption that the conditions on either side of the border were similar when HOLC established is maps and grading system. Yet this assumption may not hold in practice, as discussed by Aaronson et al 2017. In fact, Aaronson et al. argue based upon the area description forms used by HOLC assessors that the HOLC boundaries “were endogenously drawn based on information on where racial and housing gaps were already diverging” (Aaronson et al., 18). They analyze the pre-HOLC demographic trends in the buffer areas using 1910, 1920, and 1930 census data and find that the racial gap between D-C buffers was 3 percentage points in 1920 and grew to 6 percent by 1930, identifying similar patterns in other variables, including homeownership and home values. This illustrates that the pure border discontinuity design has some shortcomings as there may have already been some emerging differences between bordering buffer areas of different HOLC grades, before the HOLC maps were ever drawn. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan="3"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Therefore, we cannot make a causal statement about whether the HOLC grade designations caused the divergent outcomes we observe. However, the border buffer approach enables us to see how outcomes have diverged over time for individuals living close together in distance, yet on opposite sides of a HOLC boundary.</td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan="3"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In their paper, Aaronson et al. implement several innovative approaches to control for the endogeneity of the HOLC border drawing, enabling them to draw a much stronger conclusion than we can in our analysis. As an extension of this work, we would like to explore replicating their controls in our own analysis. </td></tr>
