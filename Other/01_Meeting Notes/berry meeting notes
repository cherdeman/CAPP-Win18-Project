Overarching methods in general 
- regression discontinuity 
- outcomes they didn't look at, redo it for the sake of redoing it (discontinuity differences is the obvious way)
- specific cities - are there different legacies by city 
- large dataset of census-level attributes 
       before, during, after
- additional outcomes - socioeconomic 
       homicide, crimes
       permanent damages 
- split it into two ways --> original, continuation, change over time

Data collection and Chicago-specific concerns
- Cook County policies: not sure 
- low income housing tax credit --> federal policies 
- community reinvestment act --> above and below threshold, did they undo redlining?
                             --> did CRA areas do better than others?
- public housing projects and how they impacted migration
                --> there's a guy here who did CRA tracking, school has the data 

Datasets and property values over long period of time
- census tract level

Anything else?
- theoretical - why are there any lingering impacts? once you remove redlining, competition should do asway with these effects, but for segregation. Redline districts cause segregation, effects do not go away --> but for racism 
- is redlining less of ghetto for less diverse cities --> less of an impact longterm
