File: explanation_of_files.txt
Purpose: guide old data directories

Each year has a few types of files:

1. CSV files: these are the raw data files. The first bit (e.g., nhgis009) says which pull it is. The rest identifies the file and table. Each file has a matching codebook. 

2. Codebook.txt files: these files match with each CSV file to provide guidance. 

3. Ipynb notebook: each notebook will create the csv file for use in the db with just the variables that we care about! 

4. "for_db.csv": the final csv file for export to the database
